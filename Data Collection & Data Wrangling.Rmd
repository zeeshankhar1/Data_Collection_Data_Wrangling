## Section 1: Manipulating Data

### Question 1 
**The dataset is loaded for you. Perform the following tasks:**  
1. use the USPersonalExpenditure dataset and store in a variable.  
2. Compute summary statistics: mean, standard deviation (sd) across time for each of the indicators.  
3. Create a new column that contains average values for each of the indicators.  


```{r }
library(help='datasets')
```


```{r }
USPersonalExpenditure
```

```{r }

```{r }

```


```{r }

```


```{r }
### end solution ####
```

### Question 2 
**download the data from the available URL:**  
1. Create a new column containing the average bodywt (body weight) of each genus and of each order.  
2. Create a dataframe containing the average REM sleep time for each order.  
3. How many missing values are there (in total) and per column?  
4. How would you like to impute missing values? Write Justification.  <i> Hint: Overall Mean/media/mode vs. Groupby Mean/media/mode?

## Section 2: Tidyverse

### Question 1
**Use the above dataset and perform the following tasks using any library from tidyverse:**  
1. Filter results to print average REM sleep and average total sleep  for those animals who are carnivores and then for those who are primates.  
2. Use the order column and "spread" it across the rest of the observations.
